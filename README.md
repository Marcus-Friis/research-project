## TODO

* ~~add embedding 191 nan~~
* do clustering
  * try more $k$ values
  * evaluate clustering with silhouette and/or H-plus and modularity when applied to graph
  * evaluate community with same as above
* compare clustering and community detection
* openai api access / script
  * COOK!
  * Evaluate stability with prompt engineering
  * Run gpt 3.5 and 4 on 100 samples multiple times, evaluate stability
  * compare with expert
* multi-layer community detection and compare
  * evaluate embedding distance between agreement, neutral and disagreennt edges
* write readme
* DONE!
